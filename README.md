#get your node-red coffee on ice!
=================================

This node works (almost) exactly like the "node-red-coffeescript" node plugin, except it has the added
value of iced coffeescript.


##Installation ##

<pre>
npm install node-red-iced-coffeescript
</pre>

##Notes##

Make sure that you have iced-coffee-script installed locally or (better) globally
